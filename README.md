### Use cases

Many cool use cases!

-   Research any topic then get entity associations that exist from that seed topic
    
-   Map out related entities with your product, service or brand
    
-   Find how well you've covered a specific topic on your website
    
-   Differentiate your pages!
    

### Stack

###   

About the stack, it's 100% [#Python](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/Python)! 🐍🔥

-   [@GCPcloud](https://twitter.com/GCPcloud) Natural Language API
    
-   PyWikibot
    
-   Networkx
    
-   PyVis
    
-   [@streamlit](https://twitter.com/streamlit)
    
-   Streamlit Components -> [streamlit.io/components](https://www.streamlit.io/components)
    

  

### **⚒️ Still To-Do’s**

-   💰 Add a budget estimator to get a sense of [@GCPcloud](https://twitter.com/GCPcloud) costs!
    
-   🌍Add a multilingual option (currently English only)
    
-   📈Add on-the-fly physics controls to the network graph
    
-   💯Add Google KG [#API](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/API) to add more data (scores, etc.) (ht [@LoukilAymen](https://twitter.com/LoukilAymen))
    

That code currently lays in a private repo. I should be able to make it public soon for you to re-use it in your own apps and creations! I just need to clean it a tad, remove some sensitive bits, etc.

  

### 🙌 Shout-outs

Kudos to [@jroakes](https://twitter.com/jroakes) for the original script. Buy that man a 🍺 for his sterling contributions! -> [paypal.com/paypalme/codes…](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/codeseo)

Kudos also to fellow [@streamlit](https://twitter.com/streamlit) Creators:

-   [@napoles3D](https://twitter.com/napoles3D) who told me about the PyVis lib! 🔥
    
-   [@andfanilo](https://twitter.com/andfanilo)/[@ChristianKlose3](https://twitter.com/ChristianKlose3) for their precious advice! 🙏
    

  

### 💲 Beware on costs!

It can get expensive quickly with that Google Natural Language API!

  

Monitor your costs via the GCP console regularly and/or put quotas to tame that G beast! I'm planning to add a budget estimator pre-API calls. Should come handy.
